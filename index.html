    <p>I watched anime like One Piece, Naruto and Baki. So far, Baki was really good even though they didn't have lots of seasons. Some reasons I like Baki is because of these: </p>
    <ul> 
        <li> Crazy physique</li>
        <li> Badass attitude</li>
        <li> Stoic mindset </li>
    </ul>

<p> My goal for 2025, as in personal lives, is to have a crazy physique, badass attitude and a stoic mindess. Thinking and writing about it makes me happy and I want to be happy all the times. Everyone should.</p>
